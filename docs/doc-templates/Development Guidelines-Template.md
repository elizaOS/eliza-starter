2. Mock Protocol Layer
   ```typescript
   // Example mock implementation
   export const mockProtocolData = {
     isActive: true,
     hasLiquidity: true,
     supportedTokens: [],
     mockValidation: () => ({ isValid: true })
   }
   ```

## Note on Scope Control

It is crucial to maintain a clear focus on the current Minimum Viable Product (MVP) version of the project. Adding new features or enhancements before the MVP is fully developed can lead to scope creep, which may delay the project timeline and dilute the core functionality we aim to deliver.

### Key Points:
- **Prioritize Core Features**: Concentrate on implementing and refining the essential features that define the MVP.
- **Avoid Distractions**: Resist the temptation to introduce new functionalities that are not critical to the MVP's success.
- **Iterate After Completion**: Once the MVP is complete and validated, we can gather user feedback and prioritize additional features based on that input.

By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure that our development efforts remain focused and efficient, ultimately leading to a more successful product launch.

Remember: Build a working mock first, then iterate with real implementations. 

## Version 1 MVP

The Version 1 Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the Artemis AI Agent project focuses on delivering core functionalities that enable basic interaction and response generation. The primary goal is to validate the concept and gather user feedback for future enhancements.

### Core Features for Version 1 MVP:
1. **Natural Language Understanding**: 
   - Implement basic NLP capabilities to process user input and generate responses.

2. **Messaging Client Integration**:
   - Integrate with Discord to allow users to interact with the AI agent.
   - Basic command handling for user interactions.

3. **Character Management**:
   - Load and manage character configurations from JSON files.
   - Validate character settings to ensure compliance with project standards.

4. **Response Generation**:
   - Utilize OpenAI's API to generate responses based on user input.
   - Implement context management to maintain conversation flow.

5. **Basic Learning Mechanism**:
   - Store user interactions for immediate context.
   - Implement a simple feedback loop to refine responses over time.

## Backlogged Features for Version 2 MVP

The following features are identified for future development in Version 2 MVP. These enhancements aim to improve user experience and expand the capabilities of the Artemis AI Agent.

### Planned Features for Version 2 MVP:
1. **Additional Messaging Client Integrations**:
   - Support for Telegram and Twitter to broaden user access and interaction.

2. **Advanced Learning Algorithms**:
   - Implement machine learning techniques to enhance the AI's ability to learn from user interactions and improve response accuracy.

3. **User Feedback System**:
   - Develop a structured feedback mechanism to gather user insights and satisfaction scores.

4. **Enhanced Character Management**:
   - Allow users to create and customize their characters dynamically.
   - Implement a more sophisticated character validation process.

5. **Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Create a dashboard for monitoring user interactions, response effectiveness, and overall system performance.

6. **Improved Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Implement comprehensive error handling to manage exceptions gracefully.
   - Set up a logging system to track interactions and system performance for future analysis.

By focusing on these core features for Version 1 and planning for enhancements in Version 2, we aim to create a robust and user-friendly AI agent that evolves based on user needs and feedback.
