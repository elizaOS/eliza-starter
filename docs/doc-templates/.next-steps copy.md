## Development Tasks for <Project Name>

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Ensure Node.js (version 22 or higher) is installed.
- [ ] Install `pnpm` if not already installed:
  ```bash
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```

### 2. Clone the Repository
- [ ] Clone the project repository to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  cd <repository-directory>
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies all dependencies
- [ ] List all project dependencies:
- [ ] Install project dependencies:
  ```bash
  pnpm install
  ```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
- [ ] Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
- [ ] Add the following environment variables:
  ```plaintext
<env example>
  ```

### 5. Set Up Dev ops
- [ ] Create a new account
  - Go to [`Resource Developer Portal`]-<websit>.
  - Create a new application.
  - Copy the API key and add it to your `.env` file.
- [ ] Set the necessary permissions for the API (e.g., sending messages, reading message history etc).

### 6. Implement Integration
- [ ] Install the required libraries:
  ```bash
  pnpm add <library>
  ```
- [ ] Create a new file `X implemntation` in the `src/plugin` directory.
- [ ] Set up the implementation logic.

### 7. Connect other Logic
- [ ] Integrate the AI agent's response logic into the Discord bot.
- [ ] Ensure the bot can process commands and respond appropriately based on the `artemis.json` configuration.

### 8. Testing
- [ ] Run the development server:
  ```bash
  pnpm run dev
  ```
- [ ] Test the bot in a Discord server to ensure it responds correctly to messages.

### 9. Learning and Adaptation
- [ ] Implement a mechanism for the bot to learn from interactions (e.g., storing user feedback).
- [ ] Set up a logging system to track interactions and responses for future analysis.

### 10. Deployment
- [ ] Prepare the application for production:
  - Set `NODE_ENV=production` in the environment variables.
  - Use a process manager like PM2 for running the bot in production.
- [ ] Deploy the application to a cloud service (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean).

### 11. Documentation
- [ ] Update the README.md file with setup instructions and usage guidelines.
- [ ] Document any additional features or configurations.

### 12. Future Enhancements
- [ ] Plan for additional features based on user feedback and interactions.
- [ ] Consider implementing more advanced learning algorithms for the AI agent.
