This guide will walk you through using Cursor AI effectively, starting with importing settings from VSCode, customizing instructions, and adding reference documents. It will also cover creating documentation files and dynamic documents like .cursorrules.md, .commentingguide.md, fyi.md, next-steps.md, and current-issues.md.

    Cursor AI's free credits renew each month, allowing you to continue using features like the Composer. As a free user, you receive a monthly allocation of 2000 completions and 50 slow premium requests. Once you've used all your free credits, you can still use the chat just not the composer, you'll need to wait until the next month for the free credits to reset.

1. To start using Cursor, go to cursor.com and download the application.

2. When you open the application for the first time, take a moment to familiarize yourself with the settings.

    I recommend watching this helpful video that guides you through the optimal setup process.

3. Importing Settings from VSCode this should include extentions

4. Go to setting -> features and scroll down to *add current documentation* to train the cursor agent. 
For example, if working with `next.js` try adding `https://nextjs.org/docs`


The 2 main AI features
The AI chat (Open it up by pressing the "Cmd/Ctrl+L")
Think of it like having an AI assistant in your code editor.
You can ask it questions about your code, to help you understand it better and it will also suggest code. Then you can then simply click to “apply” the code into your project.

Then there's the Composer (Open it by pressing “Cmd/Ctrl + I”.)
This is Cursor's newest AI feature, and it’s extremely powerful.

the composer is like a director and your the assistant.

The difference is that it can create multiple code files for you with just one instruction.

It will go ahead and implement all of the code straight away. All you have to do is “accept” or “reject” it.
So it's a lot faster than the AI chat in making big changes to your code. Just make sure it doesn't get carried away adding features and creating scope creep.

    I recommend using the Composer when you're either starting a project or know exactly what you need. You can use the AI chat to iterate on your project idea get the AI to "ask me questions" and make step-by-step guide and documentation to guide composer and then use the composure to complete it.

2# *Create guiding files* that can be called on as action prompts:
`.cursorrules` (Role: Full-Stack Development Assistant)   -- use often
`.commentguides` (guidelines for writing comments)        -- use periodically 
`.next-steps` (Focus on the task at hand)
`.fyi.md` (a comprehensive guide for the project. log of decisions, actions, and future features. 
Additionally, create and regularly update `next-steps.md` and `current-issues.md` to track short term progress and challenges.
