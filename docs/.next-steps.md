## Development Tasks for AI Agent Setup

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Ensure Node.js (version 22 or higher) is installed.
- [ ] Install `pnpm` if not already installed:
  ```bash
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```

### 2. Clone the Repository
- [ ] Clone the project repository to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  cd <repository-directory>
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies
- [ ] Install project dependencies:
  ```bash
  pnpm install
  ```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
- [ ] Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
- [ ] Add the following environment variables:
  ```plaintext
  DISCORD_TOKEN=<your-discord-bot-token>
  NODE_ENV=development
  PORT=3001
  ```

### 5. Set Up Discord Bot
- [ ] Create a new bot on the Discord Developer Portal:
  - Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
  - Create a new application and add a bot to it.
  - Copy the bot token and add it to your `.env` file.
- [ ] Set the necessary permissions for the bot (e.g., sending messages, reading message history).

### 6. Implement Discord Integration
- [ ] Install the Discord.js library:
  ```bash
  pnpm add discord.js
  ```
- [ ] Create a new file `discordBot.js` in the `server/src` directory.
- [ ] Set up the bot to listen for messages and respond using the AI agent logic.

### 7. Connect AI Agent Logic
- [ ] Integrate the AI agent's response logic into the Discord bot.
- [ ] Ensure the bot can process commands and respond appropriately based on the `artemis.json` configuration.

### 8. Testing
- [ ] Run the development server:
  ```bash
  pnpm run dev
  ```
- [ ] Test the bot in a Discord server to ensure it responds correctly to messages.

### 9. Learning and Adaptation
- [ ] Implement a mechanism for the bot to learn from interactions (e.g., storing user feedback).
- [ ] Set up a logging system to track interactions and responses for future analysis.

### 10. Deployment
- [ ] Prepare the application for production:
  - Set `NODE_ENV=production` in the environment variables.
  - Use a process manager like PM2 for running the bot in production.
- [ ] Deploy the application to a cloud service (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean).

### 11. Documentation
- [ ] Update the README.md file with setup instructions and usage guidelines.
- [ ] Document any additional features or configurations.

### 12. Future Enhancements
- [ ] Plan for additional features based on user feedback and interactions.
- [ ] Consider implementing more advanced learning algorithms for the AI agent.
